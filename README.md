# 2d-unity-college-project

Previous project, updated so that collisions with collectibles end up being removed and updates the players score. <br><br>This was a C# project built using the Unity Game Engine (ver 5.5.1) where I would have to develop a video game with set criterias.
<br><br>
<b>Key Features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Timer which on 0 resets the game if player does not manage to leave the area</li>
  <li>Collectibles which increase users score as well as being removed on pickup</li>
  <li>Enemies which move around and on collision can push the user away</li>
</ul>
